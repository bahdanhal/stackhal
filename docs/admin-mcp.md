# Administrative MCP access

The same HTTPS MCP endpoint at `https://stackhal.com/mcp` exposes public tools and a small set of administrative tools. Administrative calls fail closed unless the request contains a valid Bearer token.

## Configuration

Generate a dedicated, high-entropy token and set it only in `production.env`:

```dotenv
MARKET_ADMIN_TOKEN=replace-with-at-least-32-random-bytes
```

Configure the MCP client to send the token as an HTTP header:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <MARKET_ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

Never pass the token as a tool argument, place it in a prompt, commit it to the repository, or include it in logs. Use the endpoint only over HTTPS. Rotating `MARKET_ADMIN_TOKEN` immediately invalidates the previous credential after the application container is restarted.

## Read-only administrative tools

- `get_admin_dashboard_statistics`: privacy-preserving traffic for seven and thirty days, consultation submission totals, SEO audit outcomes, and lead-source frequencies.
- `list_admin_contact_leads`: recent consultation requests with email, phone, message, source, and timestamp.
- `list_admin_recent_audits`: recent SEO audit runs with sanitized targets, completion status, score, pages crawled, cache state, and duration.

The list tools accept an optional `limit` from 1 to 100. They never return stored IP hashes. The Stackhal MCP server has no mutating administrative tools.

`seo_audits.total` counts unique audit IDs, including validation failures that can occur before an `audit_requested` event is written. `completed` and `failed` count final run states. A blocked local or internal hostname is an expected `UnsafeUrlException` security outcome, not an application crash.

## Privacy and operations

Administrative output can contain personal data and private review material. Do not forward it to unrelated services, paste it into third-party prompts, or enable verbose request/response logging in the MCP client. Community listing links must never be fetched automatically or republished.

Traffic analytics are collected without cookies. PostgreSQL stores only the request path, a source category, an external referring hostname when present, and an HMAC-SHA256 client-IP hash. It never stores raw IP addresses, query strings, full referrer URLs, or user-agent strings. Bot-like user agents, admin and MCP paths, health checks, and requests carrying DNT or Global Privacy Control are excluded. Page-view rows are retained for at most `ANALYTICS_RETENTION_DAYS` (90 by default).

If the token may have been exposed, replace it in `production.env`, restart the application container, and remove any affected client logs.
